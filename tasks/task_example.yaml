  Spaceship Titanic — Binary Classification

  Predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during
  the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly.

  Files:
    - train.csv: Training set with labels (~8700 rows)
    - test.csv:  Test set without labels (~4300 rows)
    - sample_submission.csv: Example submission in the correct format

  Key columns:
    - PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger (format: gggg_pp)
    - HomePlanet: Planet of departure (Earth, Europa, Mars)
    - CryoSleep: Whether the passenger was in suspended animation
    - Cabin: Cabin number (format: deck/num/side)
    - Destination: Planet passenger is travelling to
    - Age: Age of the passenger
    - VIP: Whether the passenger paid for VIP service
    - RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: Luxury amenity charges
    - Name: First and last name
    - Transported: Target variable (True = transported, False = not)

  Submission format:
    CSV with two columns: PassengerId, Transported (True/False).
    See sample_submission.csv for the exact format.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional fields (shown with their defaults)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Name of the target column to predict. Passed to agent prompts as structured
# context alongside the free-text description. Set to null or omit to leave
# unspecified (agents will rely on the description alone).
target_column: "Transported"

# Path to the directory containing competition data files.
# Must already exist and contain the dataset before running the pipeline.
# Default: "./input"
data_dir: "./input"

# Path for final submission output files.
# Default: "./final"
output_dir: "./final"
