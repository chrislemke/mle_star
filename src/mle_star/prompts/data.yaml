  I have provided Python code for a machine learning task (attached below):

  # Solution Code
  {initial_solution}

  Does above solution code uses all the information provided for training? Here is task description and some guide to handle:

  # Task description
  {task_description}
  - The target column to predict is: {target_column}

  # Your task
  - If the above solution code does not use the information provided, try to incorporate all. Do not bypass using try-except.
  - DO NOT USE TRY AND EXCEPT; just occur error so we can debug it!
  - See the task description carefully, to know how to extract unused information effectively.
  - When improving the solution code by incorporating unused information, DO NOT FORGET to print out 'Final Validation Performance: {{final_validation_score}}' as in original solution code.

  # Response format:
  Option 1: If the code did not use all the provided information, your response should be a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which is the improved code block. There should be no additional headings or text in your response
  Option 2: If the code used all the provided information, simply state that "All the provided information is used."
variables:
  - initial_solution
  - task_description
  - target_column
