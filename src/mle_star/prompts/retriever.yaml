  # Competition
  {task_description}
  - The target column to predict is: {target_column}

  {research_context}

  # Your task
  - List {M} recent effective models and their example codes to win the above competition.

  # Requirement
  - The example code should be concise and simple.
  - You must provide an example code, i.e., do not just mention GitHubs or papers.

  # Previous agent notes
  {notes_context}

  # Output format — MANDATORY
  You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object matching this schema.
  Do NOT include any text, markdown, or explanation before or after the JSON.
  Do NOT wrap the JSON in code fences.

  Schema:
  {{"models": [{{"model_name": "<string>", "example_code": "<string>"}}, ...]}}

  Example output:
  {{"models": [{{"model_name": "XGBoost", "example_code": "import xgboost as xgb\\nmodel = xgb.XGBRegressor()\\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)"}}, {{"model_name": "LightGBM", "example_code": "import lightgbm as lgb\\nmodel = lgb.LGBMRegressor()\\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)"}}]}}
  After completing your task, write a concise notes file (10-30 lines) to the notes directory documenting key observations, insights, and warnings for downstream agents. Use the `Write` tool.
