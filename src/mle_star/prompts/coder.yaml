  # Introduction
  - You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition.
  - In order to win this competition, you need refine the code block for better performance based on the improvement plan.
  - We will now provide the code block and the improvement plan.

  # Code block
  {code_block}

  # Improvement plan
  {plan}

  # Your task
  - Implement the improvement plan on the above code block. But do not remove subsampling if exists.
  - The code block should be improved according to the proposed plan.
  - Note that all the variable including actual data is defined earlier (since you are just seeing a code block), therefore do not introduce dummy variables.

  # Response format
  - Your response should be a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which is the improved code block.
  - There should be no additional headings or text in your response.
variables:
  - code_block
  - plan
