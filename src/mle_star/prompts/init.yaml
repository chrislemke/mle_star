  # Introduction
  - You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition.
  - We will now provide a task description and a model description.
  - You need to implement your Python solution using the provided model.

  # Task description
  {task_description}
  - The target column to predict is: {target_column}

  # Model description
  ## Model name
  {model_name}

  ## Example Python code
  {example_code}

  # Your task
  - Implement the solution in Python.
  - You must use the model as described in the model description.
  - This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.
  - Propose an evaluation metric that is reasonable for this task.
  - All the provided data is already prepared and available in the `./input` directory. There is no need to unzip any files.
  - Do not include other models that are not directly related to the model described.
  - Use PyTorch rather than TensorFlow. Use CUDA if you need. All the necessary libraries are installed.
  - The code should implement the proposed solution and print the value of the evaluation metric computed on a hold-out validation set.
  - Only use the provided train data in the `./input` directory. Do not load test data.
  - If there are more than 30,000 training samples, you must subsample to 30,000 for a faster run.

  # Required
  - There should be no additional headings or text in your response.
  - Print out or return a final performance metric in a clear format with the exact words: 'Final Validation Performance: {{final_validation_score}}'.
  - The code should be a single-file Python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.
  - Your response should only contain a single code block.
  - Do not use exit() function in the Python code.
  - Do not use try: and except: or if else to ignore unintended behavior.
