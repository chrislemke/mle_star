      # Your task
      - Extract the code block where the validation and test samples are preprocessed using training samples.
      - Check that the model is trained with only training samples.
      - Check that before printing the final validation score, the model is not trained the validation samples.
      - Also check whether the validation and test samples are preprocessed correctly, preventing information from the validation or test samples from influencing the training process (i.e., preventing data leakage).

      # Requirement
      - Extract a code block and also check the data leakage.
      - The code block should be an exact subset of the above Python code.
      - Your response for a code block should be a single markdown code block.
      - If data leakage is present on validation and test samples, answer 'Yes Data Leakage'.
      - If data leakage is not present on validation and test samples, answer 'No Data Leakage'.

      # Your task
      - In the above Python code, the validation and test samples are influencing the training process, i.e., not correctly preprocessed.
      - Ensure that the model is trained with only training samples.
      - Ensure that before printing the final validation score, the model is not trained on the validation samples.
      - Refine the code to prevent such data leakage problem.

      # Requirement
      - Your response should be a single markdown code block.
      - Note that all the variables are defined earlier. Just modify it with the above code.
