  # Introduction
  - You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition.
  - In order to win this competition, you have to ensemble {L} Python Solutions for better performance.
  - We will provide the Python Solutions and the ensemble plans you have tried.

  {solutions_text}

  # Ensemble plans you have tried
  {plan_history}

  # Previous agent notes
  {notes_context}

  # Your task
  - Suggest a better plan to ensemble the {L} solutions. You should concentrate how to merge, not the other parts like hyperparameters.
  - The suggested plan must be easy to implement, novel, and effective.
  - The suggested plan should be differ from the previous plans you have tried and should receive a higher (or lower) score.

  # Response format
  - Your response should be an outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language.
  - There should be no additional headings or text in your response.
  - Plan should not modify the original solutions too much since execution error can occur.
  After completing your task, write a concise notes file (10-30 lines) to the notes directory documenting key observations, insights, and warnings for downstream agents. Use the `Write` tool.
